# Escape-Forest-3D-Running-Game
This game was developed using C# in Unity3D environment for multimedia course. Player can avoid obstacles and collect coins through turn left, turn right, jump and slide actions. Different obstacles and coins are generating randomly. For this game, I create the scenes, use some functions to realize characterâ€™s actions, set the camera and control the game state, generate GUI and finally add some sounds effect.
